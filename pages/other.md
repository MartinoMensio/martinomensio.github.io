[//]: # I play the classical guitar, and I have a great passion for music.
[//]: # I love music and I have been playing the classical guitar for several years. In the department we are quite a few playing instruments, and we have an experimental band called [Knowledge Media Instruments](https://www.facebook.com/kmiinstruments/).

[//]: # Besides classical music, I also liked experimenting with techniques for generating sounds and I ended up in creating quite weird stuff. Check out at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/martinomensio).



[//]: # Another things I cannot live without are activities such as biking and snowboarding.
