On the 1st of October 2019 I started my PhD at the Open University, that will keep me busy with three years of research.
My supervisors are [Harith Alani](http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/harith/) and [Alistair Willis](http://mcs.open.ac.uk/agw96/).

In my PhD I want to explore how different articles present the same events, by using different emphasis and selecting different details. To have an overview of my research, I suggest to watch the following video or take a look at &rarr; [the poster](/assets/docs/2020_OU_poster_competition.pdf) &larr; sent to the OU poster competition 2020.

A more detailed explanation of the objectives can be seen in the [position paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2593/paper11.pdf) that has been presented at the [*Text2Story*](http://text2story20.inesctec.pt/) workshop.

Currently, I am writing my Upgrade Report.
