On the 1st of October 2019 I started my PhD, that will take me through three years of research in the field of computer science applied to the field of misinformation.

The title of the PhD, as from the [proposal](/assets/docs/proposal_kmi_cc.pdf), is "*Analysis of Misinformation Cascades across Traditional and Social Media*".
