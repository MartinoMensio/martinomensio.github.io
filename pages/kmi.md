This page is about my work as Research Assistant in Knowledge Media Institute (part of the Open University).

## Topics

Following some of the topics first met in my [Master's Thesis](/master), I keep working on the conversational domain.

The main goal is to enable a voice interface on the robots in order to be able to receive commands and perform some actions.

The main challenges are related to:
- find and use a relevant dataset to train the NLU module
- perform the grounding of the objects mentioned
- analyze the feasibility of the actions required with respect to the abilities of the considered robot
- start the actions or suggest a simpler one in case the robot cannot perform the desired one

The work involves dealing with different datasets (HuRIC, FrameNet) and analyzing how a Deep Learning model can be interpreted (in terms of looking where the attention of the neural network is captured).
