I am Martino Mensio, an Italian from Torino with passion for Computer Science.
## Short bio

After the first years of my life spent around [a very little town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saluzzo), I moved to Torino to attend Computer Engineering courses. At [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it) I achieved both the Bachelor's (2015) and Master's degrees (2018).

A very important step in my academic path is the Master's thesis, done under the supervision of [Giuseppe Rizzo](http://giusepperizzo.github.io/) (from [Istituto Superiore Mario Boella](http://www.ismb.it/)) and [Maurizio Morisio](https://softeng.polito.it/morisio/) (professor in [DAUIN](http://www.dauin.polito.it/it/)). In that period I did my first steps in the Machine Learning area, focusing on the conversational domain. You can find more info on the Master's Thesis in [the dedicated page](/master).

Then I switched to United Kingdom where at the moment I am working as Research Assistant in the [Knowledge Media Institute](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/) part of The Open University.

At the moment I am looking forward interesting PhD programs around Europe.

## Other interests

I love music and I have been playing the classical guitar for several years.
