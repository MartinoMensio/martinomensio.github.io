Welcome to my portfolio! I am Martino, PhD Student at the Open University. I graduated in Computer Engineering and I am interested in Machine Learning and Explainability.

I like to understand how things work and I think that Artificial Intelligence should not just be about algorithms that learn to perform complex tasks; it should be about explainable methods that enable the crowds to understand why things happen, to be able to face and remove bias, correct models and enabling the humans to improve their learning capabilities.

## Short bio

After the first years of my life spent around [a very little town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saluzzo), I moved to Torino to attend Computer Engineering courses. At [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it) I achieved both the Bachelor's (2015) and Master's degrees (2018).

A very important step in my academic path is the Master's thesis, done under the supervision of [Giuseppe Rizzo](http://giusepperizzo.github.io/) (from [Istituto Superiore Mario Boella](http://www.ismb.it/)) and [Maurizio Morisio](https://softeng.polito.it/morisio/) (professor in [DAUIN](http://www.dauin.polito.it/it/)). In that period I did my first steps in the Machine Learning area, focusing on the conversational domain. You can find more info on the Master's Thesis in [the dedicated page](/master).

Then I switched to United Kingdom where I have been working more than a year as Research Assistant in the [Knowledge Media Institute](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/) part of The Open University. [See more here about the research topics I am working on.](/kmi_ra/)

On the first of October I started my PhD at The Open University, on the topic of misinformation. The title of my research is *Analysis of Misinformation Cascades across Traditional and Social Media*.
