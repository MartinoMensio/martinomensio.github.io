I am Martino, an Open Source passionate and mantainer: [GitHub](https://github.com/MartinoMensio/).
I got my PhD at the Open University in Data Science. My Master's Degree is in Software Engineering and I am intrigued by Natural Language Processing, backend development, and Python.

## Short bio

My path in Computer Science begins with my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Software Engineering at [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it). During my Master's thesis ["Deep Semantic Learning for Conversational Agents"](https://martinomensio.github.io/master/), under the supervision of [Giuseppe Rizzo](http://giusepperizzo.github.io/) (from [Istituto Superiore Mario Boella](http://www.ismb.it/)) and [Maurizio Morisio](https://softeng.polito.it/morisio/) (professor in [DAUIN](http://www.dauin.polito.it/it/)), I dived into the academic world. In that period I did my first steps in the Machine Learning area, focusing on the conversational domain.

For my next professional step, I worked as Research Assistant in the [Knowledge Media Institute](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/), part of The Open University. Here I participated in different projects, varying from  conversational agents to misinformation (more details [here](/kmi-ra/)).

Between 2019 and 2023 I did my PhD at The Open University. During [my PhD](/phd/) I am analysing how specific topics are portrayed by news outlets coming from different political leanings.

In 2024 I joined [TNO](https://www.tno.nl/en/) as Research Scientist, focusing on applied Machine Learning in multiple projects.
