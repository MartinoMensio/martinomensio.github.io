I am Martino, PhD Student at the Open University. I graduated in Computer Engineering and I am intrigued by Natural Language Processing and Explainability.

I like to understand how things work and I think that Artificial Intelligence should be more than algorithms that learn to perform complex tasks; we have to focus about explainable methods that enable the crowds to understand why things happen, to be able to face and remove bias, correct models and enabling the humans to improve their learning capabilities.

## Short bio

My path in computer science begins with my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it). At the end of these 5 years, I became more and more interested in the world of academy during my Master's thesis, done under the supervision of [Giuseppe Rizzo](http://giusepperizzo.github.io/) (from [Istituto Superiore Mario Boella](http://www.ismb.it/)) and [Maurizio Morisio](https://softeng.polito.it/morisio/) (professor in [DAUIN](http://www.dauin.polito.it/it/)). In that period I did my first steps in the Machine Learning area, focusing on the conversational domain. You can find more info on the Master's Thesis in [the dedicated page](/master/).

Then I moved to United Kingdom where I have been working since May 2018 as Research Assistant in the [Knowledge Media Institute](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/) part of The Open University. Here I continued working on NLP tasks and moving my domain from conversational agents to misinformation (more details [here](/kmi-ra/)).

On October 2019 I started my PhD at The Open University. During my PhD I am analysing how single topics are portrayed by news outlets coming from different political leanings [take a look here](/phd/).
