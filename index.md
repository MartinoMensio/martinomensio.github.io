I am Martino, PhD Student at the Open University. I graduated in Software Engineering and I am intrigued by Natural Language Processing and Explainability.

I am highly interested in open source. I am currently concluding my PhD in Data Science, and I am working part-time as Research Assistant at the Knowledge Media Institute (UK).
As soon as I will submit my PhD thesis, I am looking forward to relocating in the Netherlands around June and start working full time. I am currently on the lookout for software engineering / data science roles that allow me to showcase my enthusiasm for hands-on projects that produce tangible outcomes.

## Short bio

My path in computer science begins with my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it). At the end of these 5 years, I became more and more interested in the world of academy during my Master's thesis, done under the supervision of [Giuseppe Rizzo](http://giusepperizzo.github.io/) (from [Istituto Superiore Mario Boella](http://www.ismb.it/)) and [Maurizio Morisio](https://softeng.polito.it/morisio/) (professor in [DAUIN](http://www.dauin.polito.it/it/)). In that period I did my first steps in the Machine Learning area, focusing on the conversational domain. You can find more info on the Master's Thesis in [the dedicated page](/master/).

Then I moved to United Kingdom where I have been working since May 2018 as Research Assistant in the [Knowledge Media Institute](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/) part of The Open University. Here I continued working on NLP tasks and moving my domain from conversational agents to misinformation (more details [here](/kmi-ra/)).

On October 2019 I started my PhD at The Open University. During my PhD I am analysing how single topics are portrayed by news outlets coming from different political leanings [take a look here](/phd/).
